So, my name is XX and I'm currently pursing my master's degree in computer engineering at New York University, where I developed a strong foundation in software development and a passion for solving complex problems through code. I chose to transfer to this field of study from electronic engineering at my undergraduate program because I've always been interested in computers and software. I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.

Even though I don't have any real-life work experience, I've had a lot of exposure to projects that involved solving real problems. I have hands-on experience with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This position seems like a great opportunity to advance those skills I just talked about, and continue building my career and challenging myself.

I'm excited about the opportunity to work with your team and I believe my background in web application development and my passion for continuous learning align well with your team's goals.



## Why

### Why CE in Master

在本科过程中也有很多的CE课，选修了之后发现CE更有趣一些，更能做出产品。而ee做出能够使用的产品并且能够推销出去是十分困难的，不仅有成本的问题，也有渠道的问题。对于CE来说，只要将产品放到APP Store上放到网上就可以被世界上所有人用到。我希望自己的创业和成果能够为人所知，改变世界，所以这是CE吸引我的一大原因



### Why NYU

因为这个项目更适合转专业，可以有很多时间来巩固基础。在现今快节奏迭代的趋势下，想做出一个成品可以很快，但要想做出一个好的产品，是需要扎实的基础知识和对底层的深刻理解的，NYU给了我这样一个机会去能够去学习更根本的知识。

# Leadership







# Teamwork

### Describe a teamwork experience, your role, team result

During my project course at undergraduate program, I worked with other nine members to design a smart robot car that have functions like line tracking, obstacle avoiding, wireless communication, shape recognition and something like that. My role was to implement ultrasonic sensors to enable the robot to avoid barriers. It was not very difficult to complete my own function, but when it came to the cooperation with other modules, we had a really hard time combining each other’s code together. Also, I found that the robot could not work well because measurement under different weather conditions would lead to inaccurate and changing parameters. So to solve these problems, we had a discussion about what we have done so far and explained how it worked respectively to each other so that we could have a basic understanding of others’ work.  In addition, after repeating measurement under different conditions like sunny, cloudy and rainy days, we determined three sets of suitable parameters accordingly. Finally we successfully improved the stability and reliability of our work and in the final demo, our robot car had a great performance and even achieved the top 10.







## Conflict

### Describe a time you solved a conflict

When I was working on a course project with another classmate, we were stuck in a problem that the response time of our product page was very slow, so we planned to improve that first. But that's where we had a conflit. My thought was that the design of our databsse table is problematic, and this resulted in too many requests and slowing down the loading time, so we should redesign it. But my teammate insisted that changing the database would cause more potential problems since there are a lot of code need to be modified, so we should introduce caches. We both felt we had a point and couldn't persuade each other. As it's approaching the deadline, I proposed that we all want to make the product better, and it's useless to argue which side is better, so maybe we could work together to spend about half a day to write a simplified version of both methods, and then we could make a test and choose the better solution. He agreed to my proposal and finally, after a series of analysis, he understood my point and thought my plan was reasonable, and I also understood his idea in this way. The whole process significantly improved the efficiency between our teamwork and also enabled us to move smoother in the future.



Follow-up: What if you cannot persuade your colleagues although you try a lot?

- If this thing is on my priority list, I will insist on my idea. Put my idea into practice quickly and verify it is right or not. If after fast prototyping and I found my idea is proved to be wrong, I will correct my errors.



## Communication

### Given a task to complete in an unrealistic time frame

I will approach my manager and say the following: 
I am having trouble to wrapping my head around how to complete each steps of the project to for it to be down in that time frame.

Can we sit down and talk through to the all the tasks that I think need to be done in order for us to achieve it. Also would you mind if we go through the estimated time to achieve it, because may be I am missing some details or wrongly estimated the time needed for some tasks. Maybe we can cut out some steps or maybe we are over thinking it here. Can we work through this together?

Maybe my manager or myself don’t have all the information, maybe I am misinterpreting the task. So before I started to have tons of assumptions and get emotional, I should sit down and ask for clarification.





# Attitudes and Values

## Strength

### What is your strength

I think one of my strength is to be organized. As I have to do multitasks, I usually use to-do lists and a diary to help me successfully manage my work.This method not only helps in prioritizing tasks but also in tracking progress and deadlines, ensuring that nothing is overlooked.This can also significantly enhance efficiency. By knowing exactly what needs to be done and when you're less likely to waste time on unnecessary tasks.



## Weakness

### What's your weakness

My weakness is that sometimes, I may lose focus on the whole project while plunge into very detailed problems. It's not bad to spend more time finding the best solution. But it may be better to finish the most critical part first. As it is, I'll draw the whole design on paper and put it just in front of the monitor so that I can easily find out what I should focus on.



### Where to imporve

作为一个New grad, 我的weakness就是缺少中作经验，但是答到这还没完。对于这样的negative question，当然要有转折。接下来就要说这不是个问题，我有internship experience, 做过很多projects, tech skills上和team work都有经验，不是个大问题，再来句自己是个fast learner。包括正在申请的同学，如果你想转专业，这个也是个很好的回答方式。如果不是new grad的前辈，可以看看下一题的回答。



As a student, my weakness is to be lack of work experience, so it might not be very competitve for me to stand out. However, I had internship experience, as well as many projects and tech skills, and also had team work experience that is necessary in real work. So I think it might not be a big issue for me. Besides, I'm a fast learner and thrive on learning new technologies. I have strong interest in web development. I learned React front-end framework by doing projects and released that in just 2 months.



### What to dislike about previous job/intern

转换成 **What to wish had done differently**

作为new grad/ intern，希望自己involve到很多的task，所以对这个prioritization做的不是很好。但是知道这是不对的，我现在也慢慢做了调。

I‘ve had problems in the past with taking on too many projects and then not delivering quality and, in some cases, not delivering on time. I was simply stretched too thin in too many areas with not enough time to deliver in a quality manner. I think that's the opportunity that is there as a new college student, you want to do everything and be involved in everything. However（敲黑板）, I've learned that I'm not at my best when I have too many conflicting priorities. I've had to cut back on some of the less important extracurricular activities to focus on delivering my academic projects with the highest quality. This prioritization of my work has carried over to my work life with my recent internship. I had several key deliverables that were due the same week, so I met with my boss to prioritize the delivery schedule. She helped me focus on both the timing and the quality of the delivery. In the end, all three projects were delivered with high quality results.





## Failure

### Tell me about a time you failed / What's your most regretful decision in your work?

I remember in the database course last semester when I was working on a project with two teammates. We were required to build a car-renting website. After we had a meeting and confirmed the detailed requirements for the whole project, we planned to divide all the work into three parts, frontend, backend and database. I was responsible for the backend design. In the beginning all things went well, but when trying to combine different modules together, we encountered many issues. For example, I didn't handle exception in somewhere like user login because I thought that was supposed be the work from frontend side. But the frontend also thought so. So we might spend a lot of time debugging and integrating all the work. Since there were still some time before the deadline, I organized a online meeting with the other two partners and discussed the problem we were facing and had a deep analysis on the workload and what should we do in the next step and finally we decided to spend half a day to clarify the responsibilities scope. If I had a time to do that again, I would at first spend more time on project analysis, confirming everybody's work scope and identifying specific interfaces before carrying out the work. Also I would try to have regular meeting sbecause it is very important in making everyone's catching and understanding others' work progress. These would be really helpful in avoiding many potential problems when we're moving forward.





## Success





## Challenge

### Most challenging project / the project most proud of / favorite project

I think the most challenging project that I have done is a React web application. It's the second project on my resume. I implemented a personal notes application and I applied ReactJS for the frontend development, which is also a very popular frontend framework. I used convex for backend services because it's a backend development platform for fullstack and I just wanna focus on the frontend. But the difficulty was the integration part between react and the convex since there were a lot of modules working together. So to conquer it, I read a lot of source code in the documentation and also discussed with my friends in the industry and then tried for many times and finally, when I saw the website was built and deployed online, I was very proud of it.



(While I was working on my final year project at undergraduate program, I needed to analyze some large social networks and use the given information like the existing links and nodes in these networks to predict the potential ones that might appear in the future. At first, I was really confused and have no idea what I was doing. Then I seeked to my instructor for help, and he gave me some recommendation on some related papers. After I'd learned a lot from others' methods, I thought of common neighbors, the most commonly used index, to predict and evaluate the complex network. Then I divided the data into a test set and a training set using Python and evaluated the prediction accuracy with several metrics such as the precision. However, after many times of testing, the results were unsatisfactory. So to improve the accuracy, I realized that the traditional ways might not be suitable for large networks, so I started to searched for more advanced and effective methods and I found robust PCA useful to perform matrix completion and estimated the missing terms. So I implemented this method into my work and finally my method was proved to be very effective and the prediction accuracy has been greatly improved from about 40% to 60%.)
