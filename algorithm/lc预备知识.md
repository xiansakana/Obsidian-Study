# Tree

- A **full** binary tree (sometimes referred to as a **proper**, **plane**, or **strict** binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

- A **perfect** binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children _and_ all leaves have the same _depth_ or same _level_ (the level of a node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node). A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree.

- A **complete** binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, _except possibly the last_, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h^ nodes at the last level _h_.

- A **balanced** binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height (the number of edges from the top-most node to the farthest node in a subtree) by no more than 1 (or the skew is no greater than 1).

- A **binary search tree (BST)**, also called an **ordered** or **sorted binary tree**, is a [rooted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooted_tree) [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.
